The MyBatis data mapper framework makes it easier to use a relational database with object-oriented applications.
MyBatis couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements using a XML descriptor or annotations.
Simplicity is the biggest advantage of the MyBatis data mapper over object relational mapping tools.

Users are advised to upgrade to myBatis 3.  Both mybatis (ibatis) 2 and mybatis 3 can be used together.  Changes to this repo will only be considered if small bug fixes.  Given its widespread usage still, this repo will be kept alive as java conditions change as long as needed.
